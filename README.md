# vira
Video editor for raspberry pi.<br />
DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS! Any bugs will be fixed, sorry for them.<br />
Hopefuly, not only for raspberry pi.
# how to use
git clone https://GitHub.com/bondpe/vira.git<br />
cd vira<br />
python3 interface.py
# try:
add new stream [Edit>Add]<br />
edit it's position, cut it [Stream>* ]<br />
add more streams<br />
select them by clicking<br />
add effects, but they are REALLY slowing down viewport and exporting<br />
use scale button on bottom if working with big streams, segment if with great number of them<br />
you can create up to an hour-long video if your memory card, hard drive etc. is big enough<br />
export it [Edit>Export] (don't add effects for faster export, the fastest default effect, brightness correction, slows it down more than a hundred times, I think<br />
you may save [File>SaveAs] or pack [Edit>Pack] your work, and then [File>Open]<br />
the difference: if saved, you just can't delete video files from drive for it to work well, and you can't save unpacked project, it packs instead<br />
remember, top items on streamer are on top of everything<br />
