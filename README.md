# vira
Video editor for raspberry pi.<br />
DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS! Any bugs will be fixed, sorry for them.<br />
Hopefuly, not only for raspberry pi.
# how to use
git clone https://GitHub.com/bondpe/vira.git<br />
cd vira<br />
python3 interface.py
# try:
add new stream [Edit>Add]<br />
edit it's position, cut it [Stream>* ], arrow keys, Ctrl-arrow keys, shift-arrow keys<br />
add more streams<br />
select them by clicking<br />
reorder them with blue-arrows button<br />
add effects, but they are REALLY slowing down viewport and exporting<br />
edit effects, by clicking on value you want to edit<br />
use scale button on bottom if working with big streams, segment if with great number of them<br />
you can create up to an hour-long video if your memory card, hard drive etc. is big enough<br />
export it [Edit>Export] (don't add effects for faster export, the fastest default effect, brightness correction, slows it down more than a hundred times, I think)<br />
you may save [File>SaveAs] or pack [Edit>Pack] your work, and then [File>Open]<br />
the difference: if saved, you just can't delete video files from drive for it to work, because they aren't cloned into saved video, and you can't save unpacked project, it packs instead. Also, packing is a little bit slower<br />
remember, top items on streamer are on top of everything<br />
